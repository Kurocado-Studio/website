## Contributing

- [See how to contribute](https://kurocado-studio.github.io/styleguide/contributing.html)

## Deployment

- [See the Deploy Workflow](https://kurocado-studio.github.io/styleguide/deploy-workflow.html)

First, build the app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is
production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
